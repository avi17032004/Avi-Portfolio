          Hi, I'm <span className="text-yellow-300 font-semibold">Avinash B</span>, a passionate and driven web developer with a
          Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications (BCA), graduated in 2024.
          After graduation, I completed a full-fledged MERN Stack Development
          course, gaining hands-on experience in both frontend and backend
          technologies. My technical toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, React.js, Redux, Node.js, Express.js,
          MongoDB, and SQL. I specialize in building modern, responsive, and
          user-friendly web interfaces using React and Tailwind. While I'm
          confident working across the full stack, my primary focus is on
          Front-End Development and crafting seamless user experiences. I enjoy
          turning complex problems into elegant solutions through clean code and
          intuitive UI design. Currently, I'm seeking opportunities as a React
          Developer, Front-End Developer, or MERN Stack Developer. I'm eager to
          contribute to exciting projects and grow as part of a forward-thinking
          tech team.
